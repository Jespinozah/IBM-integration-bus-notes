## IBM Integration Bus processes messages in two ways
1. Message routing
   Messages can be routed from sender to recipient based on the content of the message.
2. Message transformation
   Messages can be transformed before being delivered:
   - They can be transformed from one format to another, perhaps to accommodate the different requirements of the sender and the recipient.
   - They can be transformed by modifying, combining, adding, or removing data fields, perhaps involving the use of information stored in a database. Information can be mapped between messages and databases. More complex manipulation of message data can be achieved by writing code, for example in Extended SQL (ESQL) or Javaâ„¢, within configurable nodes.
