# Introduccion to IIB

## IBM Integration Bus themes
1. Simple and productive
2. Universal and independent
3. Industry specific and relevant
4. Dynamic and intelligent
5. High performing and scalable
6. Transform and route data from anywhere, to anywhere
7. Patterns provide reusable solutions
8. Operational managment and performance

## IBM Integration Bus features
1. Transform and route data from anywhere to anywhere
2. Patterns provide reusable solutions that encapsulate a tested approach to solving a common architecture, desing, or deployment task
3. Operational managment and performance

## IBM Integration Bus main components
1. Integration node
   - The runtime engine of IBM Integration bus
2. Message flows
   - Provides isolation and scalability
3. Application
   - Container for all the resources that are  required to create a solution

## IBM Integration Bus runtime components
1. Integration node
   - Routes, transforms, and enriches in-flight messages as determined by message
flows and message models.
   - Can be many integration nodes, each running on separate systems to provide
protection against failure or separate the work.
2. Integration server
   - Named grouping of message flows that are assigned to an integration node.
   - Each integration server is a separate operating system process, which provides
isolated runtime environments for a set of deployed message flow applications.
3. Message flow applications
   - Describe the application connectivity logic, which defines the exact path that the
data takes in the integration node, and the processing that is applied to it by the
message processing nodes in that flow.
   - Reference message models that describe the data.

## IBM Integration Bus operation modes
   Operation modes typically restrict the number of message flow nodes that are available, and
integration server capacity, but many features are available across all modes of operation. This
figure summarizes four of the IBM Integration Bus operation modes: Express, Scale, Standard, and
Advanced. IBM Integration Bus is also available in Developer mode and Adapter mode.

   1. Express
   2. Scale
   3. Standard
   4. Advanced

## IBM Integration Bus processes messages in two ways
1. Message routing
   Messages can be routed from sender to recipient based on the content of the message.
2. Message transformation
   Messages can be transformed before being delivered:
   - They can be transformed from one format to another, perhaps to accommodate the different requirements of the sender and the recipient.
   - They can be transformed by modifying, combining, adding, or removing data fields, perhaps involving the use of information stored in a database. Information can be mapped between messages and databases. More complex manipulation of message data can be achieved by writing code, for example in Extended SQL (ESQL) or Javaâ„¢, within configurable nodes.

# Application development fundamentals

## Main components
   1. Integration node
      Routes, transform, and enriches messages as determined bye message flows and message models.
   2. Integration server
      Named gruping of message flows.
   3. Message flow
      Sequence of operations
   4. Message flow nodes
      Define operations
   5. Message models
      Define structure and properties of the data

## Basic IBM Integration Bus commands

   1. *mqsilist*
       List the IBM Integration Bus components on the system
   2. *mqsistart*
       Start components
   3. *mqsistop*
       Stop components

# Modeling the data

## Message modeling
   - Most messages require a model at run time to parse the message bit stream from the physical data and serialize to create the physical bit stream from model.
   - Modeling accelerates the development of transformations at design time in the IBM Integration Toolkit
   - Validationn can be used for checking message correctness when parsing.

## Message model object properties
   - Logical model is a format-independent description, similar to default values.
   - Physical model
   - Documentation does not affect processing

## Parser types
   - Programmatic parsers
   - Descriptive parsers
   - IBM Integration Bus uses both approaches

## Model definition files
   - Describe the logical structure of the message
   - Describe the physical formats of the message bit stream during transmission.
   - Can be imported from WSDL, an XML schema, DTD, COBOL ord C.
   - Contains a message model with message, elements, types, and so on
   - Based on XML schema standards

## Data Format Description Language (DFDL)
   - An open standart from Open Grid Forum (OGF)
   - Uses XML technology and concepts
   - Describes any data format
   - Support round-trippig

## When should you use DFDL?
   - Use DFDL to model:
     - Binary data
     - Text data with delimiters such as csv
     - Text industry standars
     - Binary industry sntandars
   - Do not use DFDL to model:
     - XML data that can use XML parsers and have a XML schema
     - JSON that can use JSON parsers
   -  Do not use DFDL expressions to implement complex validation rules

# Processing file data

## Files processing node
   1. Generic
      - FileInput
      - FileRead
      - FileOutput
   2. IBM Sterling Connect: Direct
      - CDInput
      - CDOutput
   3. IBM MQ File Transfer Edition
      -FTEIput 
      -FTEOuput
